# Super Breakout LIVE

Educational market analysis platform focused on rare high-quality market states.

## Purpose
This project is designed to analyze market compression, vacuum, and tension states
to help identify moments of potential high-energy market release.

The platform does NOT provide trading signals.
It is built for discipline, context, and decision support.

## Core Concepts

- Vacuum: liquidity absence and imbalance
- Tension: directional pressure build-up
- Release: expansion after prolonged compression

## Key Principles
- Trade less, not more
- Focus on rare, high-quality market conditions
- Avoid overtrading and noise
- Leverage is only logical after structure, never before

## Architecture
- Frontend-only web application
- Live market data via WebSocket
- No backend price processing
